      <description>Automated Testing Now its time for something fun, this post is going to be taking the ideas from the previous post and giving you all an example of how they can be applied. We are going to be building out test nodes in our vCD environment, built from an valid image for running kubernetes, then taking our backups we have in our etcd gitlab repo and restoring our cluster to these new nodes.</description>

      <description>Building something in CI/CD In this post im am going to start exploring what all can be done with CI/CD pipelines in reguards to Kubernetes. So most people have been using CI/CD to deploy out their applications or modify their application that is running to fix a bug or address some feature request. But what can us infrastructure guys do with this? Well everyone seems to preach these days the infrastructure as code right?</description>

      <description>The Setup This article is about how to configure our Rancher test ENV.
WTF Am i doing? This is what I want to have setup here:
 Rancher RKE Deployment in AWS with ETCD snapshots enabled writing to /opt/rke/snapshots Gitlab single node instance running on the cluster Turns out we have to scp it off the host first then do the rest on the bastin host Git init /opt/rke/snapshots as a repo etcd-snapshots Create cron job that runs:  git add .</description>

      <description>The Setup In the previous post we talked about deploying some hosts using the vcd-cli so one thing you might be asking is &amp;ldquo;How can I view the state of this&amp;rdquo;. Well you could always just login to the console and go check things one at a time but who really has time for that? There are also several canned reports that you could use to gather and show you this information, but why wait for the report to generate when you wanna see the health or current utilization of things?</description>
